I need to first retrieve the current content of the file to make the updates. However, since I don't have a tool to read file contents, I'll need you to provide the current content of the index.html file so I can make the requested changes and update it.

Alternatively, if you can share the current file content, I can apply all these changes:

1. **Title change:** "Global Brand Launch: Unilever & JTI" → "Global Brand Launch: Unilever & Henkel"

2. **Description change:** "Launched Dove/Rexona and JTI into the market. Secured 60% aerosol shelf share and implemented 4-tier outlet segmentation." → "Launched Dove/Rexona and Henkel Laundry & Detergents (Persil, Clin, Bref) into the Azerbaijan market. Secured 60% aerosol shelf share and executed the 2009 Master Plan."

3. **Label change:** "Partnership" → "Pricing Strategy"

4. **Partnership/Pricing Strategy content change:** "Collaborated with McCann Erickson on creative strategy." → "Aggressive positioning: -2% to -4% vs competitors."

Could you please provide the current content of the index.html file so I can apply these updates?
